# An analysis of kickstarter campaigns

## Overview of Project
  * In this project, I analyzed two different data sets to help Louise determine the best course of action for her fundraiser for the play "fever".

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
  * I started with an entire dataset of kickstarters with a wide array of goals and categories. A challange was to determine how to filter the data to best suit Louise's project. it was determined that we would analyze the outcomes of the kickstarters based on launch date and goals. 

  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    * From previous kickstarters in the category of "theatre", the most successful kickstarters were launched in May. If not May, the summer months of April through August would be the best times to launch the campaign. The least succesful campaign launches seemed to have started in the winter months of September through March. Please refer to the chart ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://github.com/chenylk/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png).
  

  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    * The next set of data that was analyzed was the outcomes based on goals for the subcategory of "plays". Previous kickstarters have shown that the rate of most success falls in the goal range of 25000-34999 and "greater than" 45000. Please refer to the chart ![

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
