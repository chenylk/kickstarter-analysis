# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
  * In this project, I analyzed two different kickstarter data sets to help Louise determine the best course of action for her fundraiser, the play "fever". 

## Analysis and Challenges
  * I started with an entire dataset of kickstarters with a wide array of goals and categories. A challange was determining how to filter the data to best suit Louise's project. Tt was determined that we would analyze the outcomes of the kickstarters in the theatre and play category based on launch date and goals. This helped limit the data to kickstarters that were similar to Louise's. A limitation of the dataset is the variety of countries being examined. A kickstarter in one country could have a different outcome in another. Additional data that should be examined are looking at the successful kickstarters in relation to the backer count. If more backers correlated to a higher success percentage, then Louise would have to look into how to increase the amount of people pledging money to her fundraiser. The data did show that there are decisions that Louise can make to increase her chance at a successful fundraiser. 

  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   *From previous kickstarters in the category of "theatre", the most successful kickstarters were launched in May. If not May, the summer months of April through August would be the best times to launch the campaign. The least succesful campaign launches seemed to have started in the winter months of September through March. Furthermore, the failed kickstarters had no trends in terms of when they launched throughout the year. It would be best if Louise started her fundraiser in a summer month.

  ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
   *The next set of data that was analyzed was the outcomes based on goals for the subcategory of "plays". Previous kickstarters have shown that the rate of most success falls in the goal range of 0-9999 and 35000-44999.

## Recommendation 
 * I would recommend for Louise to start her fundraiser in May and have the goal be set to either the 0-9999 range or the 35000-44999 range.
